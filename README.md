# System Deteksi Penipuan Kartu Kredit
System Deteksi Penipuan Kartu Kredit (Credit Card Fraud)

# This repo is for a backup homework assignment for my master's degree 

Why is this repository public? I just did it because I felt like it.


The dataset I used in this notebook is 

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud (Unuse)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data (MAIN DATASETS)


## Launch the Streamlit app.
To run the Streamlit app (`app.py`), you must have both a dataset and the app in the same folder.  
```example layout folder 
proyek-deteksi-fraud/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ app.py # File skrip utama aplikasi Streamlit
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ fraudTrain.csv # File dataset yang akan dibaca oleh aplikasi
```
### Run the Streamlit application.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the app.py and fraudTrain.csv files. Then, run the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
